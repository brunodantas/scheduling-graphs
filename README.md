### Formatting

- Number of vertices n is given in the filename, e.g.: lap**36**.txt

- The first n lines are the respective weights of the n vertices, where vertex indexes start at 0.

- The following line contains the number of edges e.

- The following e lines contain each directed edge in the format `v1 v2 weight`.
